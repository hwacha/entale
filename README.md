An open-world game with autonomous agents the player can freely talk to using a robust language system.

## How To Use

### Controls
Use ``WASD`` to **move** and the mouse to look around. To bring up the **workspace** press ``TAB``. To bring up the **word** menu press ``TAB`` again. To add a word, hover over an option to select a type with a mouse ``Click``, and then hover over an option to select a word. To exit either menu press ``Escape``.

When in the **workspace** use WASD or the ``Arrow Keys`` to focus on an expression. To **select** an expression, press ``Enter``. When an expression is selected, you can **use** it by pressing ``Q`` or you can combine it with another expression by pressing ``Enter`` on an open argument slot.

If you've pressed ``Q`` on an expression, the workspace should disappear and you'll have the expression in front of you. You can **say** this expression to an NPC by looking at an NPC and pressing ``Q``.

### How to Play
Use the workspace to combine expressions and form sentences to say to NPCs. These sentences all mean something different, and will have a different effect on the NPC. You can make requests, ask questions, or assert facts about the game world. The NPC will respond accordingly.

At this stage of development, most focus has been put on the AI system behind the scenes, so there isn't much content to try out, and most of it is opaque to the player. In the future, the language will be tutorialized so the player learns how to use it over the course of play. Also, there will be more gameplay and NPC behavior available to contextualize the use of the language.
